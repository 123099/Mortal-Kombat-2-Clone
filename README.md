# MortalKombat 2 Clone

## Description

This is a multiplayer 1v1 MortalKombat 2 clone with basic networking, animations, sound, and combat.

This was my very first "big" game project that I have created back in 2011, when I was just 13-14 years old.

All the source files were decompiled from the game's jar file as I have long lost the original files. Fortunately, it looks like all the variable, function, and class names were preserved as I have written them back in 2011.
